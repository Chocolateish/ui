All trigonometry functions in this library must follow this order of parameters, unneeded parameters are just skipped, but the order must be kept
x           (position in x-axis)
y           (position in y-axis)
z           (position in z-axis)
centerX     (position of center on x-axis)
centerY     (position of center on y-axis)
centerZ     (position of center on z-axis)
width       (width of item)
height      (height of item)
depth       (depth of item)
angle
